# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

In this project, I built a simple sorting algorithm visualizer using the Pygame library. Upon launch, the program generates an array of integers of a specified size and range. Then, the user can choose to perform several sorting algorithms on the list. Each step of the sorting process is visualized using colors to highlight the current elements that are being evaluated.

## Usage

R - Resets the initial array of values <br />
I - Performs insertion sort on the generated list <br />
B - Performs bubble sort on the generated list
